- The main problem: there are some moral views where values are real numbers, or multi-valued, or infinite, or binary yes or no, or satisficing, and so on. These things are not directly comparable. But we never have zero credence in anything, so we always have to weigh them in when making decisions. How?
	- When phrased this way, it becomes clear that maybe some limitations on what counts as a "moral view" are necessary. Saying "my ethical system says that to kill this man would not be right or wrong nor permissible nor obligatory, it would be cupcake" is clearly nonsense, and should have to be compared against other possibilities when evaluating decisions. Maybe we don't have to deal with comparing "obligated" vs "permissible" vs "blameworthy" and such. 
	- How to limit though??? Fully no idea. This stuff is wicked complicated
