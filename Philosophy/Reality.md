- So I'm not actually sure how to define reality in a useful or coherent way, or what it means for a thing to "exist" aside from being capable of influencing observations.
	- Problem is, reality does matter for [[Ethics]], and especially consequentialism. And it would be kind of strange for the True Universal (Consequentialist) Morality to be expressed not in terms of all entities that exist, but in terms of all entities that are necessary to fully explain the observations of the agent.
		- Different sets of moral patients can exist for different people!
- Yudkowsky's colony spaceship example. I am concerned with consequences I cannot verify, but not consequences I cannot affect. If the spaceship leaves my observable universe, I still care that it lands and populates its destination. But if the spaceship is never in my observable universe, as far as I'm concerned it doesn't exist.
	- Since it is in my light cone at some point, it does affect my observations at some point. But for prediction purposes, it's the same if it disappears upon leaving, or continues to "exist". The reason I think I care is that my current epistemology suggests it should continue to exist.
- So my current best answer is that the set of things that exist is the same as the set of things that I care about consequentialism-wise, and the same as the set of things I can (in theory) affect.
